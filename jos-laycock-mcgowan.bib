This paper argues that native stereotypes about language struc- ture and use play a critical role in formulating the pragmatic value(s) of register systems. The linguist can neither isolate the forms belonging to a register, nor explain their significance in use, independently of appeal to native stereotypes about language. The paper discusses methods for the em- pirical study and analysis of such stereotypes. Stereotypes that formulate the social identity of language users play a special role within register systems, grounding the significance of pragmatic acts in the attributes of pragmatic actors. Much of the discussion focuses on how such stereotypes are formu- lated and what their social consequences are. (Honorifics, pragmatics, meta- pragmatics, stereotypes, registers, deference, identity, Tibetan).},

This article proposes that the strictly linguistic information encoded in reportative evidentials cannot be cleanly separated from social influences. Defining an information source, especially when referring to information reported by another person, serves social purposes, such as casting doubt, framing gossip, distancing oneself, or indicating empathy. Using the concept of speaker stance, this study explores the relationship of information source to the interpersonal relationships and interactions that are encoded in this linguistic form. Data from a contact variety of Spanish spoken in central Bolivia provide evidence that diz(que), a Spanish word, has undergone influence from Quechua to become a systematic reportative evidential marker in this variety of Bolivian Spanish. Speakers use information source marking in order to shade subtleties of relationships and authority.

We also examine whether non-native word durations lead to judgments of a stronger foreign accent. We measured word durations in English paragraphs read by 12 American English (AE), 20 Korean, and 20 Chinese speakers. We also had AE listeners rate the [`]accentedness' of these non-native speakers. AE speech had shorter durations, greater within-speaker word duration variance, greater reduction of function words, and less between-speaker variance than non-native speech. However, both AE and non-native speakers showed sensitivity to lexical predictability by reducing second mentions and high-frequency words. Non-native speakers with more native-like word durations, greater within-speaker word duration variance, and greater function word reduction were perceived as less accented. Overall, these findings identify word duration as an important and complex feature of foreign-accented English.},

	abstract     = {Although coarticulatory variation is largely systematic, and serves as useful information for listeners, such variation is nonetheless linked to sound change. This article explores the articulatory and perceptual interactions between a coarticulatory source and its effects, and how these interactions likely contribute to change. The focus is on the historical change VN (phonetically, {\~V}N) > {\~V}, but with more general attention to how a gesture associated with a source segment comes to be reinterpreted as distinctively, rather than coarticulatorily, associated with a nearby vowel or consonant. Two synchronic factors are hypothesized to contribute to reinterpretation: (i) articulatory covariation between the duration of the coarticulatory source (here, N) and the temporal extent of its effects ({\~V}), and (ii) perceived equivalence between source and effect. Experimental support for both hypotheses is provided. Additionally, the experimental data are linked to the historical situation by showing that the contextual conditions that trigger (i) and (ii) parallel the conditions that historically influence phonologization of vowel nasalization.},

Experiment 1 investigated talker-dependent adaptation by comparing native English listeners' recognition accuracy for Chinese-accented English across single and multiple talker presentation conditions. Results showed that the native listeners adapted to the foreign-accented speech over the course of the single talker presentation condition with some variation in the rate and extent of this adaptation depending on the baseline sentence intelligibility of the foreign-accented talker. Experiment 2 investigated talker-independent per- ceptual adaptation to Chinese-accented English by exposing native English listeners to Chi- nese-accented English and then testing their perception of English produced by a novel Chinese-accented talker. Results showed that, if exposed to multiple talkers of Chinese- accented English during training, native English listeners could achieve talker-independent adaptation to Chinese-accented English. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for highly flexible speech perception processes that can adapt to speech that deviates substantially from the pronunciation norms in the native talker community along multiple acoustic-pho- netic dimensions.},

	abstract     = {Recent work demonstrates that listeners utilize talker-specific information in the speech signal to inform real-time language processing. However, there are multiple representational levels at which this may take place. Listeners might use acoustic cues in the speech signal to access the talker's identity and information about what they tend to talk about, which then immediately constrains processing. Alternatively, or simultaneously, listeners might compare the signal to acoustically-detailed representations of words, without awareness of the talker's identity. In a series of eye-tracked comprehension experiments, we explore the circumstances under which listeners utilize talker-specific information. Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrate talker-specific recognition benefits for newly-learned words both in isolation (Experiment 1) and with preceding context (Experiment 2), but suggest that listeners do not strongly semantically associate talkers with referents. Experiment 3 demonstrates that listeners can recognize talkers rapidly, almost as soon as acoustic information is available, and can associate talkers with multiple arbitrary referents. Experiment 4 demonstrates that if talker identity is highly diagnostic on each trial, listeners readily associate talkers with specific referents, but do not seem to make such associations when diagnostic value is low. Implications for speech processing, talker processing, and learning are discussed.},

We investigated hemispheric dominance for language in language-impaired children with autism and typically developing controls to investigate the hypothesis that atypical functional specialization for language represents one component of developmental language impairment in autism. Late field magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings were used to calculate a hemispheric Lateralization Index from the neuromagnetic activity evoked by passive auditory presentation of vowel stimuli. Results indicate that children with autism and typically developing children follow opposite maturational trajectories in language lateralization; while leftward lateralization (i.e. left hemisphere dominance) emerged from bilaterally symmetric neuronal activation as age increased in our sample of typically developing children, rightward lateralization emerged from bilaterally symmetric activity as age increased in our sample of children with autism.},

In that time, experimental methods have evolved, constraints on stimulus materials have evolved, sources of variance have been identified, and computational models have been advanced. As a result, the slate of candidate units has increased, each with its own empirical support. In this article, we endorse Grossberg's adaptive resonance theory (ART), proposing that speech units are emergent properties of perceptual dynamics. By this view, units only ``exist'' when disparate features achieve resonance, a level of perceptual coherence that allows conscious encoding. We outline basic principles of ART, then summarize five experiments. Three experiments assessed the power of social influence to affect phoneme-syllable competitions. Two other experiments assessed repetition effects in monitoring data. Together the data suggest that ``primary'' speech units are strongly and symmetrically affected by bottom-up and top-down knowledge sources.},

Hintzman, 1986) against speech production data from a word-shadowing task. The model predicted the shadowing-response-timepatterns, and it correctly predicted a tendency for shadowers to spontaneously imitate the acoustic patterns of words and nonwords.It also correctlypredictedimitationstrengthas a functionof "abstract" stimulusproper- ties, such as word frequency. Taken together, the data and theory suggest that detailed episodes constitute the basic substrate of the mental lexicon.},

As the transfer of discourse and rhetorical norms from a first to a second language commonly occurs, we predict that a Chinese variety of English is characterised by a number of discourse and rhetorical norms derived from Chinese. We argue that the presence of these L1 discourse and rhetorical norms should not be seen as `deviations' from Anglo norms, but that, as Chinese speakers are more likely to use the language with other English speakers in the East Asian region rather than with speakers of inner circle varieties of English, the Chinese variety of English is actually a more culturally appropriate model of English than any superimposed `Anglo' norm. Our discussion also considers the importance in China traditionally attached to `models' and `standards' and speculates on the extent to which educators and officials in China are likely to accept a Chinese variety of English as a model for the classroom.},

Moreover, listeners are sensitive to details of creak production, suggesting that a more detailed representation of creak than a binary flag for the presence of creak is needed in tonal representation and automatic tonal recognition.},

Specifically, we asked how native and non-native Hebrew speaking listeners perceive accented and native-accented Hebrew speech. To achieve this goal we used the gating paradigm to explore the ability of healthy late fluent bilinguals (Russian and Arabic native speakers) to recognize words in L2 (Hebrew) when they were spoken in an accent like their own, a native accent (Hebrew speakers), or another foreign accent (American accent). The data revealed that for Hebrew speakers, there was no effect of accent, whereas for the two bilingual groups (Russian and Arabic native speakers), stimuli with an accent like their own and the native Hebrew accent, required significantly less phonological information than the other foreign accents. The results support the hypothesis that phonological assimilation works in a similar manner in these two different groups.},

A long running debate about the architecture of the spoken-word recognition system has centered on the locus of lexical effects on phonemic processing: does lexical knowledge influence phoneme perception through feedback, or post-perceptually in a purely feedforward system? Elman and McClelland (1988) reported that lexically restored ambiguous phonemes influenced the perception of the following phoneme, supporting models with feedback from lexical to phonemic representations. Subsequently, several authors have argued that these results can be fully accounted for by diphone transitional probabilities in a feedforward system (Cairns et al., 1995; Pitt \& McQueen, 1998). We report results strongly favoring the original lexical feedback explanation: lexical effects were present even when transitional probability biases were opposite to those of lexical biases.},

	abstract     = {The present study provides an elaboration of the "double-weak" theory of speech perception proposed by Nearey (1990, 1991). In this framework, the objects of speech perception (and production) are viewed as neither primarily auditory nor primarily gestural; rather, they are abstract, symbolic elements lawfully constrained to map onto relatively simple (but not entirely transparent) patterns in both domains. Speech cannot be understood unless both articulation and acoustics are considered: Many production strategies appear to be directed at achieving acoustically-oriented goals, yet most context effects in speech perception seem to be motivated by the consequences of gestural overlap. The double-weak framework suggests that speech perception and speech production are less-than-perfect inverses of each other. Despite long-term accommodation of each for the demands of the other, real-time production and perception may operate as autonomous subsystems. A family of perceptual models is discussed that provides varying degrees of approximation to "ideal solutions" (in the sense of minimizing error rate) to classifying production data exhibiting contextual interactions. Members of this family that provide substantial, yet incomplete, compensation for the consequences of gestural overlap appear to be adequate to account for the results of many speech perception experiments. Such partial perceptual compensation allows, in principle, for the kind of imperfect "error correction" discussed by Ohala (1981, 1990) in conjunction with hypo-and hypercorrec-tion phenomena.},

The results show that native-German-speaking listeners are able to identify (to name) imitated accents bet- ter than authentic non-native accents, probably due to the presence or absence of stereotypical patterns being used by the speakers. However, listeners were less able to judge the authenticity of the presented accents which probably can be related to the wide variation in the speakers' ability to imitate an accent.},

Minda, 1997) presented evidence that they claimed challenged the predictions of exemplar models and that supported prototype models. In the authors' view, this evidence confounded the issue of the nature of the category representation with the type of response rule (probabilistic vs. deterministic) that was used. Also, their designs did not test whether the prototype models correctly predicted generalization performance. The present work demonstrates that an exemplar model that includes a response-scaling mechanism provides a natural account of all of Smith et al.'s experimental results. Furthermore, the exemplar model predicts classification performance better than the prototype models when novel transfer stimuli are included in the experimental designs.},

Two subjects identified and categorized the same set of perceptually confusable stimuli varying on separable dimensions. The identification data were modeled using Sbepard's (1957) multidimensional scaling-choice framework. This framework was then extended to model the subjects' categorization performance. The categorization model, which generalizesthe context theory of classificationdevelopedby Medin and Schaffer(1978), assumes that subjects store category exemplars in memory. Classification decisions are based on the similarity of stimuli to the stored exemplars. It is assumed that the same multidimensional perceptual representation underlies performance in both the identification and Categorizationparadigms. However,because of the influence of selectiveattention, similarityrelationships change systematicallyacross the two par- adigrns.Somesupport wasgainedforthe hypothesisthat subjectsdistribute attention amongcomponent dimensions so as to optimize categorization performance. Evidence was also obtained that subjects may have augmented their category representations with inferred exemplars. Implications of the results for theories of multidimensional scaling and categorization are discussed.},

	abstract     = {Duplex perception---the simultaneous perception of a speech syllable and of a nonspeech  chirp ---occurs when a single formant transition and the remainder (the  base ) of a synthetic syllable are presented to different ears. Two experiments were conducted to test whether the speech percept derives from the dichotic fusion of the transition with the base or from phonetic information extracted directly from the isolated transition. Experiment 1 showed that subjects were unable to assign speech labels to isolated transitions in a consistent manner, although the same transitions led to accurate identification when paired with the constant base in the other ear. Experiment 2 used an AXB paradigm to show that selective attention to the ear receiving the base does not prevent the contribution of the contralateral transition to the speech percept. Both experiments support the hypothesis that the speech percept in the duplex situation results from dichotic fusion at a relatively early stage in processing.},

Indexical order is central to analyzing how semiotic agents access macro-sociological plane categories and concepts as values in the indexable realm of the micro-contextual. Through such access their relational identities are presupposed and creatively (trans)formed in interaction. We work through several classic examples of indexicality well-known in the literature of sociolinguistics, the clarification of which can be enhanced by using the concept of indexical order, viz., [`]T/V' deference-indexicality, speech levels, indexically significant variation in phonetics informed by a standard phonological register. We conclude with an analysis of identity-commoditizing indexical overlays such as the American English register here dubbed ``oinoglossia,'' `wine talk'.},

However, even at the highest noise levels and largest image sizes, subjects gazed at the mouth only about half the time. For the eye target, perceivers typically gazed at one eye more than the other, and the tendency became stronger at higher noise levels. English perceivers displayed more variety of gaze- sequence patterns (e.g., left eye to mouth to left eye to right eye) and persisted in using them at higher noise levels than did Japanese perceivers. No segment-level correlations were found between perceiver eye motions and phoneme identity of the stimuli.},

Auditory English primes were either typical of a Dutch accent or typical of a Japanese accent in English and were presented to both Dutch and Japanese L2 listeners. Lexical-decision times to subsequent visual target words revealed that foreign-accented words can facilitate word recognition for L2 listeners if at least one of two requirements is met: the foreign-accented production is in accordance with the language background of the L2 listener, or the foreign accent is perceptually confusable with the standard pronunciation for the L2 listener. If neither one of the requirements is met, no facilitatory effect of foreign accents on L2 word recognition is found. Taken together, these findings suggest that linguistic experience with a foreign accent affects the ability to recognize words carrying this accent, and there is furthermore a general benefit for L2 listeners for recognizing foreign-accented words that are perceptually confusable with the standard pronunciation.},

	abstract     = {The question of correlation between dialect and perception (that is, categorization) of synthetic vowels by speakers of different dialects of English was investigated experimentally for speakers from Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada, and Buffalo, New York. Eighty-eight high-school-age subjects were administered three tests in which they were asked to associate synthetic vowel sounds with English words. The results of these tests were compared with previously established phonetic features of the subjects' dialects. A correlation was found (1) between categorization of the opposition /{varepsilon}/-/ae/ (bet/bat) and dialectal difference in pronunciation of the phoneme /ae/, (2) between categorization of the opposition /ae/-/{alpha}/ (hat/hot), and dialectal difference in pronunciation of the phoneme /{alpha}/. A third pair of oppositions, /e/-/i/ (bait/beet) and /o/-/u/ (boat/boot), showed problematic results which are discussed. It is concluded that the use of synthetic vowel perception tests in dialectology allows rapid and objective collection of data relevant to phonetic features of spoken dialects, and can assist in clarifying the phonetic nature of differences among dialects.},

	abstract = {We recently proposed the attention schema theory, a novel way to explain the brain basis of subjective awareness in a mechanistic and scientifically testable manner. The theory begins with attention, the process by which signals compete for the brain’s limited computing resources. This internal signal competition is partly under a bottom–up influence and partly under top–down control. We propose that the top–down control of attention is improved when the brain has access to a simplified model of attention itself. The brain therefore constructs a schematic model of the process of attention, the ‘attention schema,’ in much the same way that it constructs a schematic model of the body, the ‘body schema.’ The content of this internal model leads a brain to conclude that it has a subjective experience. One advantage of this theory is that it explains how awareness and attention can sometimes become dissociated; the brain’s internal models are never perfect, and sometimes a model becomes dissociated from the object being modeled. A second advantage of this theory is that it explains how we can be aware of both internal and external events. The brain can apply attention to many types of information including external sensory information and internal information about emotions and cognitive states. If awareness is a model of attention, then this model should pertain to the same domains of information to which attention pertains. A third advantage of this theory is that it provides testable predictions. If awareness is the internal model of attention, used to help control attention, then without awareness, attention should still be possible but should suffer deficits in control. In this article, we review the existing literature on the relationship between attention and awareness, and suggest that at least some of the predictions of the theory are borne out by the evidence.},

	isbn = {978-0-19-960047-2},
	abstract = {Before the twentieth century, there was little appreciation of the fact that mental activity can occur without consciousness. Now unconscious mentality is widely accepted. This owes, in part, to Freud who emphasized unconscious motivations, but belief in the unconscious became more deeply entrenched with the rise of experimental psychology, and the discovery that human behavior is often best explained by appeal to processes that take place without awareness. Unconscious perception is one of the most extensively studied phenomena of this kind. There is extensive evidence that we respond to stimuli presented to our senses without awareness. In this chapter, I will review some of that evidence and raise several questions: what does it mean to say that there is unconscious perception? Is the evidence decisive? And how does unconscious perception differ from conscious perception? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

	doi = {10.1016/s0010-0277(00)00123-2},
	abstract = {This introductory chapter attempts to clarify the philosophical, empirical, and theoretical bases on which a cognitive neuroscience approach to consciousness can be founded. We isolate three major empirical observations that any theory of consciousness should incorporate, namely (1) a considerable amount of processing is possible without consciousness, (2) attention is a prerequisite of consciousness, and (3) consciousness is required for some specific cognitive tasks, including those that require durable information maintenance, novel combinations of operations, or the spontaneous generation of intentional behavior. We then propose a theoretical framework that synthesizes those facts: the hypothesis of a global neuronal workspace. This framework postulates that, at any given time, many modular cerebral networks are active in parallel and process information in an unconscious manner. An information becomes conscious, however, if the neural population that represents it is mobilized by top-down attentional amplification into a brain-scale state of coherent activity that involves many neurons distributed throughout the brain. The long-distance connectivity of these 'workspace neurons' can, when they are active for a minimal duration, make the information available to a variety of processes including perceptual categorization, long-term memorization, evaluation, and intentional action. We postulate that this global availability of information through the workspace is what we subjectively experience as a conscious state. A complete theory of consciousness should explain why some cognitive and cerebral representations can be permanently or temporarily inaccessible to consciousness, what is the range of possible conscious contents, how they map onto specific cerebral circuits, and whether a generic neuronal mechanism underlies all of them. We confront the workspace model with those issues and identify novel experimental predictions. Neurophysiological, anatomical, and brain-imaging data strongly argue for a major role of prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and the areas that connect to them, in creating the postulated brain-scale workspace.},

	abstract = {The article reports 4 experiments that explore the notion of recognition without awareness using words as the material. Previous work by Voss and associates has shown that complex visual patterns were correctly selected as targets in a 2-alternative forced-choice (2-AFC) recognition test although participants reported that they were guessing. The present experiments sought to extend this earlier work by having participants study words in different ways and then attempt to recognize the words later in a series of 4-alternative forced-choice (4-AFC) tests, some of which contained no target word. The data of interest are cases in which a target was present and participants stated that they were guessing, yet chose the correct item. This value was greater than p ϭ .25 in all conditions of the 4 experiments, demonstrating the phenomenon of recognition without awareness. Whereas Voss and colleagues attributed their findings with kaleidoscope patterns to enhanced processing fluency of perceptual attributes, the main factor associated with different levels of recognition without awareness in the present studies was a variable criterion for the subjective state accompanying selection of the “guess” option, depending on the overall difficulty of the recognition test. We conclude by discussing some implications of the results for the distinction between implicit and explicit memory.},
