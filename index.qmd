  Sociophonetic perception is often studied using versions of the matched guise technique. Linguists using this technique appear united in the methodological assumptions that participants believe the manipulation and that this belief influences perception below the level of introspective awareness. We report an audiovisual matched guise experiment with a novel 'unhidden' instruction condition. The basic task is a replication of the Strand effect [@strandJohnson1996; @strand1999]. Participants in the 'unhidden' condition were instructed that the man or woman in the photo did not represent the voice they were listening to. Participants in both guises exhibited the Strand effect to nearly numerically identical extents. This result suggests that participants need not believe a link exists between a voice and a purported social category for visually-cued social information to influence segmental perception. We explore the implications of this result for the MGT and for theories of social awareness and speech perception more broadly.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

There is abundant, converging evidence from experimental, ethnographic, and sociocultural approaches to the study of language that gender is performed by talkers and perceived by interlocutors through a stylistic bricolage [@zimman2017] comprising both non-linguistic and linguistic resources [@barrett2014; @bucholtz2002]. Gender is a culturally-situated practice, and, crucially, social meaning is performed by embodied voices that simultaneously produce the distinctions necessary for both social and linguistic meaning [@hall2021language; @podesvaKajino2014; @bucholtzHall2016; @sumner2014]. This intersection of the construction of social and linguistic meaning via precise, dynamic speech articulation is perhaps nowhere more evident than in the palato-alveolar and alveolar fricative categories, [Êƒ] and [s], in words like *ship* and *sip* in English [@strand1999; @mackMunson2012b; @calder2018].

There is little consensus, however, around the extent to which language users are aware of, and can control, these fine gradations of social meaning in production and perception. In the context of this chapter we are using 'awareness' to refer to explicit, conscious awareness of the tripartite relationship between a social label, its phonetic reflexes, and the connections between them [@bakhtin1981]. The cognitive reality of this tripartite relationship between the concepts of gender identities and instances of fine phonetic detail is essential for the performance of those identities. This observation remains true regardless of talker and listener awareness. One can *control*, in production, the phonetics of one's gender without explicit acknowledgement or introspective awareness that one is doing so or what those details might be. Indeed, children as young as 4, well before any effects of puberty might have arrived, will do precisely this [@perryOhdeAshmead2001] and many of our own college students, when first confronted with the idea that they participate in the social construction of gender through the fine phonetic details of their speech will respond with real, sometimes agitated, disbelief. Even trained, experienced sociolinguists and phoneticians tend to conceive of the fundamental frequency of the voice, the prevailing frequency of vocal fold vibration during voiced sounds, as the primary, biological phonetic detail associated with gender performance [@foulkesDocherty2006,  p. 411]; when this cue is neither necessary nor sufficient for the production and perception of gender identity [@zimman2017; @johnson2005].

The concept of control, in perception, is less clear, but it is necessary to explore perceptual control for the purposes of the present chapter. Here we owe much of our general conceptualization of 'control' to Preston's [-@preston1996; -@preston2016] four modes of awareness but with the stipulation that the ability to 'perform' or 'employ' the linking relationship between a social label and its phonetic reflexes is just as clearly a task for the listener as it is for the talker. A listener must be able to control, to link, the auditory cues of a performed gender identity to the cognitive representation of that identity just as much as a talker's vocal tract must be capable of the gestural control required to implement the phonetics of that identity if the tripartite, dialogic construction of identity in discourse is to occur. Again, none of this *requires* introspective awareness as perception and even attention are possible without awareness on the part of the perceiver [@craik_recognition_2015; @prinz_unconscious_2015; @graziano_attention_2015; @dehaene_towards_2001].

Clarifying these definitions and exploring their implications for perception is important because gender perception is a phenomenon that crosses disciplinary and subdisciplinary boundaries and approaches to language and social meaning. With these varying disciplinary and subdisciplinary contexts come quite different, sometimes contradictory, assumptions and theoretical commitments about the extent to which language users can bring aspects of perception into introspective awareness and control (conscious or otherwise). Even more than this, there are at least two, quite distinct, meanings in regular use for the word 'perception' [@mcgowanBabel2020]. Researchers, typically working within the fields of segmental speech perception or word recognition use perception to describe a kind of low-level, fast, processing of sensory input [see @evans2008, 'type 1' processing] into linguistic units like segments [@lisker1986; @pierrehumbert2003phonetic], speech gestures [@Fowler1986], and words [@gaskell2002representation; @Goldinger1998]. Perception, thus construed, is typically assumed to be automatic and to occur below the level of conscious awareness [@Joos1948, p. 63] and inaccessible to introspection even, in the case of subcategorical phonetic differences, by researchers themselves [@whalen1984]. @Johnson2006 (pp. 492-494) proposes the word as the lowest level of linguistic experience that most language users typically have awareness of.

The other meaning of perception in common use in the various language disciplines describes a higher-level, perhaps somewhat slower, evaluative judgment of talkers and voices [see @evans2008, 'type 2' processing]. This is the meaning of perception employed in folk linguistics [@niedzielskiPreston2000] and perceptual dialectology [@cramer2021]. This is the level of perception, for example, at which the sociolinguistic monitor is proposed to operate[^1 ][@labovEtAl2011]. Importantly for the present study, this higher, evaluative level of perception is the level for which the Matched Guise Technique (MGT) was originally developed.

In their foundational use of the technique, for example, @lambertEtAl1960 found that four bilingual Montrealer's voices evoked quite different social evaluations in their French vs their English guises. Using the same talkers in both guises allowed researchers to control for "idiosyncratic settings of the voice" that might distract judges from the focus of the experiment [@laver1968]. Lambert et al. were clearly concerned that the evaluative judgments they sought were subject to listeners' subjective awareness; taking pains to deceive participants with filler voices, withholding the information that some of the talkers in the study might be bilingual, and ultimately reporting that, "[t]here was no indication that any S became aware of the fact that bilingual speakers were used" [@lambertEtAl1960, p. 44].

One, perhaps surprising but recurring, demonstration of the two distinct uses of the term perception described here is that, when both levels are examined in the same study, listeners' low level perceptions and high level evaluations need not agree. @mcgowanBabel2020, for example, found that listeners' performance on an AXB vowel discrimination task and their answers in a subsequent interview about the voices heard in that task sometimes agreed, but sometimes diverged. When they diverged, the low level perceptions tracked vowel categories established by the listeners' earlier experience with the voice while high level evaluations of the talker much more closely tracked the Quechua-dominant or Spanish-dominant speaker social labels provided by the experiment.

In an early use of the MGT to study listeners' evaluations of regional accents in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, @milroyMcClenaghan1977 employed four speakers to each perform their own single accent: Received Pronunciation, Ulster, Dublin, or Scottish. They note that Lambert's bilingual investigation in which "unknown to the judges a single speaker was heard
in different guises ... seems more suitable for use in the bilingual situation where it was originally developed than for use with different accents." (p. 2). The methodological consideration here is one of control, rather than awareness, on the part of both talker and listener. Milroy & McClenaghan express "grave reservations" that a single talker, even a talented mimic, could authentically control all four of the regional varieties to be evaluated. Unstated in this preoccupation with production is the corresponding concern that listeners will not *believe* the mimicked accents.

The predominantly protestant Ulster listeners in this task provided both subjective evaluations of the voice quality of each talker on 8 personal characteristics such as intelligence, generosity, and friendliness and were asked to name the region associate with each voice. While the personal characteristics ratings closely tracked expected ideologies for an Ulster judge responding to a Scottish, RP, Dublin, and Ulster accent, the participants proved almost entirely incapable of correctly labeling each variety [see also @clopperPisoni2004; @campbell-kiblerVolume]. Milroy and McClenaghan suggest in their conclusion that perhaps accent identification "takes place below the level of conscious awareness" with stereotypical associations of a given accent arising in the listener independently of a conscious ability to name that accent.


[^1]: Although, in their response, [@levonFox2014] are careful to refer exclusively to *evaluation* rather than perception.


## The adoption and extension of the Matched Guise Technique {#sub-mgt}

The Matched Guise technique has been deployed in numerous configurations but, at its core, the technique pairs a single linguistic signal: such as an identical talker [@giles1970], identical recordings [@rubin1992; @Niedzielski1999], identical texts with multiple talkers [@milroyMcClenaghan1977], or some combination of these. This signal is paired with multiple purported social categories to investigate the influence of those categories on participants' evaluations [@campbell-kibler2005; @campbell-kibler2007] or language attitudes [@hadodoVolume; @chan2021].

In social, segmental speech perception research, cross-modal audio/visual extensions of the MGT are common in which visual information serves as a 'guise' for identical voice recordings. This usage of the technique is far enough from the original studies in which social information was communicated entirely through the voice that researchers sometimes disregard that even so-called standard voices carry social information [@rubin1992] while others and sometimes take the combination of voice and visual stimuli into account [@McGowan2015; @campbell-kibler2016; @gnevsheva2017]. This type of guise manipulation has been called â€˜invertedâ€™ matched guise [@McGowan2015] or simply â€˜identificationâ€™ [@drager2013].

But uniting these linguistic researchers, and delineating them from
colleagues in social psychology [for discussion, see
@rosseelGrondelaers2019], is the methodological assumption that the
connection of voice to social type needs to happen below the level of
conscious awareness. Awareness here, though generally not explicitly
acknowledged, appears to be construed narrowly as participantsâ€™ ability
to identify and comment on the existence of a guise manipulation. As
researchers we demonstrate our assumption that the Matched Guise
technique must be shielded from listener awareness through attempt to
deceive participants about the intentional use of guise to elicit
evidence of social evaluations, language attitudes, segmental speech
perception, memory, etc.

Researchers go to great lengths to ensure this lack of awareness [e.g.
@pharaoKristiansen2019; @grondelaersVanGent2019]. However, the majority
of studies cannot speak to this lack of awareness during phonetic
perception because the data provided by the participants is relatively
late in processing and involves layers of potential introspection and
evaluation that block access to the initial online percept for listeners
and researchers alike. @mcgowanBabel2020 performed an audio/visual MGT
with both a task designed to get at phonetic perception of individual
segments and a sociolinguistic interview intended to investigate
listeners' judgements about the purported speaker. Every participant was
shown both guises and while segmental and social perceptions were
aligned with the identity of the purported talker in the initial guise
presentation, these perceptions diverged in the second guise â€“ with
phonetic perceptions remaining unchanged and social evaluations tracking
the change of guise. Of particular relevance to the present study,
despite the fact that the fricatives used in @mcgowanBabel2020 were not
different across guises, participants often commented on how the
fricatives participated in communicating the purported social identity.
This work raises the likelihood of at least two levels of sociophonetic
perception and suggests that further work is needed to understand the
role of awareness, and the necessity of deception, for the "complex,
multi-layered process" of perception [@BabelVolume].

### 

Articulatorily, these fricatives mainly differ in the distance between the point of lingual articulation and the teeth. The size of the resulting space behind the teeth gives these sounds their characteristic sibilance [@fant1960; @shadle1991]. English [s] has a short resonating chamber behind the teeth; it is typically produced by holding the tongue tip near enough to the alveolar ridge to cause relatively high frequency turbulent airflow. English [Êƒ] has a comparatively larger resonating chamber; it is typically produced with a more posterior, palato-alveolar tongue position which creates a larger resonating chamber between the place of articulation and the teeth, causing lower frequency noise than an [s] for the same talker. Concomittant with this articulatory difference for English listeners is a cultural association of masculinity with larger, longer vocal tracts and femininity with smaller, shorter vocal tracts [@may1976; @ohala1994; @eckert2012]. [s] produced from a larger vocal tract will typically be lower in frequency than an [s] produced from a smaller vocal tract, and listeners know this [@may1976]. This effect is, in practice, entirely separable from between-talker differences in fundamental frequency (F0) and, like F0, can be used to perform and perceive gender identity.

A commonly used methodology in speech perception research involves the creation of synthetic fricative continua between [Êƒ] and [s] . These continua have endpoints in prototypical examples of [Êƒ] and [s] with some number of acoustic steps spliced, synthesized, or even mixed between these. Near the middle of such a continuum will be a synthetic fricative that is ambiguous as to category membership: not clearly a [Êƒ] and not clearly an [s]. @may1976 paired such a continuum from [Êƒ] (centered at 2.9 kHz) to [s]
(centered at 4.4 kHz) with synthetic [Ã¦] vowels to form simple CV syllables. May found that listeners perceived a higher proportion of the fricative continuum as [Êƒ] when paired with vowel stimuli from a smaller vocal tract. The logic here is that smaller resonating chambers between the lingual articulation and teeth will have a higher mean frequency than larger resonating chambers. Listeners' use of apparent vocal tract size in perception reflect their knowledge of this variation [@munson2011].

Previous research in sociophonetic perception has established that listeners are so acutely sensitive to the alignment of these acoustic facts and cultural associations that perceived gender and fricative category participate in a relationship that is highly reminiscent of a phonetic trading relation [@repp1982] such that, for example, fricative sounds consistent with a larger vocal tract are perceived as more masculine [@bouavichithEtAl2019] and, in tandem, believing that a talker identifies as male can lead listeners to perceive more [Êƒ]-like sounds as [s] [@strandJohnson1996; @munson2011].

The goal of the present study is to take advantage of this sociophonetic trading relation in listeners' fricative categories to explore the role of awareness in socially-informed speech perception. It is well established that social information can influence how listeners perceive [@foulkesDocherty2006], retrieve [@walkerHay2011], and even remember [@nygaard1994] the linguistic aspect of the speech signal. However, because our knowledge of these phenomena come from disparate intellectual traditions, working with a range of quantitative and qualitative methods, with differing assumptions about the role of introspective awareness during the integration of social and linguistic information [@babelCampbell-kiblerMcGowanVolume], one can come away from a detailed, rigorous review of the sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, and phonetics literature simultaneously convinced that listeners' use of social information happens both obligatorily above and below the level of conscious awareness.

## Coarticulatory and Social Information Influence [Êƒ]-[s] perception

Listeners are sensitive to these socially-informative patterns of
[Êƒ]-[s] variation, but it is important to understand how similar this
sensitivity is to what has previously been observed in segmental speech
perception. Just as vocal tract size can alter the frequencies of
fricatives [e.g. @may1976], so too can coarticulation with a following
vowel. Due to both place of articulation of the vowel and a change in
lip rounding, the fricative in *see* [si] or *she* [Êƒi] will sound
higher than the fricative in *sue* [su] or *shoe* [Êƒu]
[@MannRepp1980; @kunisakifujisaki1977; @whalen1981]. @whalen1984 paired
synthesized vowels with incongruously coarticulated fricatives and found
that, although researchers could not consciously identify the mismatched
stimuli, participants nevertheless showed longer reaction times due to
these coarticulatory mismatches. Listeners will readily fill-in missing
or ambiguous information, the presence of actively *incongruous*
articulatory information slows listener judgments.

Working in the context of segmental speech perception, @MannRepp1980
replicated May's (1976) finding, extending it to natural productions of
vowels spoken by a male or female-identified talker. Similar to May's
results with simulated vocal tract size, Mann & Repp found a higher
proportion of the fricative continuum was heard as [Êƒ] when paired
with the speech of the female talker. This early work, as was common in
the period [@ohala1984], theorized size as being a relatively
deterministic feature of talker sexual dimorphism. One consequence of
this view is that gender-related variation in the speech signal was
considered mechanistic, universal, and following from purely physical
laws. If vocal tract size is presumably not available for individual
performance then listener knowledge of this variation can be
correspondingly simple. Vocal tract size may influence perception, but
it does so implicitly, automatically, and below the level of
introspective awareness.

@strandJohnson1996 conducted a pair of experiments investigating the
influence of purported gender of a talker on the perception of the
[Êƒ]-[s] boundary. In their first experiment, listeners heard a [Êƒ]-[s]
continuum paired with voices previously normed as prototypically female,
non-prototypically female, prototypically male, and non-prototypically
male. The result replicates @MannRepp1980 and extends it to show that
the influence of a gendered voice correlates with the protypicality of
that voice. Their second experiment finds that presenting listeners with
prototypically-gendered videos of their purported talker can, again,
shift perceptions of the [Êƒ]-[s] such that listeners report hearing a
higher proportion of the continuum as [Êƒ] when watching a female
talker and a higher proportion of the same continuum as [s] when
watching a male talker.

This AV condition is reminiscent of @McGurkMacDonald1976 and is
presented in that context. In the McGurk Effect, listeners presented
with, for example, video of a person pronouncing the syllable [ga],
paired with audio of the syllable [ba] will experience a third, fused,
percept [da]. A striking feature of this effect is its automaticity;
participants can not choose to perceive the two components of a fused
percept independently. Awareness of the manipulation does not undermine
the effect. Indeed, @greenKuhlMeltzoffStevens1991 found that the McGurk
Effect succeeds even when listeners know that the visual talker and the
auditory talker can not be the same person. McGurk can occur below the
level of introspective awareness or, with instruction, above the level
of introspective awareness. However, listeners, even with awareness, can
not control their experience of the effect.

Listeners' phonetic judgments, whether above or below the level of
conscious awareness, depend on a rich constellation of evidence and
expectation. Vocal tract size, following vowel quality, coarticulatory
cues, and visual information, along with the acoustic properties of the
coarticulated fricative itself, can all shape how listeners report
experiencing a particular fricative. Rather than relying on a single,
invariant, phonetic cue, listeners take the entire fricative and context
into account [@whalen1991]. It is conceivable that such exquisite
sensitivity to the phonetic cues conveying linguistic category
membership might somehow restrict language users' freedom to communicate
and perceive social information via the same phonetic signal. This would
be the prediction of a phonetic theory in which linguistic information
and social information share the phonetic signal in a kind of zero sum
game --where listeners must normalize away social variation to recover
linguistic information or lose linguistic information in favor of the
social. Instead, with these fricatives at least, we can observe the
opposite. The fricatives [Êƒ] and [s] often carry social meaning
[@podesvaKajino2014; @mackMunson2012b] with [s] being "perhaps the
most iconic phonetic variable in the field" [@calder2018]. The
implication is that the social and linguistic meanings of particular
phonetic cues are not necessarily in competition with one another.

It is unclear from @strandJohnson1996 and subsequent work whether the
perceptual influence of visually-presented social information about
gender is implicit and automatic, as observed with coarticulation, vocal
tract size, and the McGurk effect or whether the effect is altered (or
diminished) when listeners are made aware of the manipulation and their
attention is drawn to socially-meaningful variables [@labovEtAl2011].
The present work seeks to resolve this cognitive question to better
understand precisely how the stylistic bricolage of gender is perceived and how gender perception functions in interaction. How do linguistic and non-linguistic resources
interact during perception and, finally, what happens when these signals
conflict? In order to conduct this study, however, it is necessary to be
precise about how we conceive of and operationalize gender for the
purposes of a speech perception experiment.

## Phonetics, Speech Perception, and the Social-Construction of Gender

It has long seemed normal in phonetics to imagine that gender is a
simple, binary projection from biological sex onto social identity
[@daniel2007; @samolinski2007]. However, if these biological tendencies
were simply deterministic we would expect to see differentiation emerge only at puberty. It does not. In fact, prior to the onset of puberty, girls' oral and nasal cavities tend to be larger than those of boys [@samolinski2007]. If anything, we should expect lower formants and lower center and peak frequencies for girls, inverting the adult pattern. Instead what we observe is that listeners can differentiate the voices of children as young as 4 years of age using vowel formant frequencies [@perryOhdeAshmead2001]. @schellingerMunsonEdwards2017 report a pair of experiments in which participants heard words produced by children between the ages of 2 and 5, and provided continuous ratings identifying fricatives, vowels, and gender typicality. Children typically show gendered patterns in speech at age 4 and up despite vocal tract length being non-distinct for this cohort. It is critical to remember that formants and fricatives are the result of not purely vocal tract biology but also articulator coordination. Even without biologically-differentiated vocal tracts, people who identify as male or female can perform that identity through gestural style. Vowels, in both their linguistic and social aspects, are the acoustic consequence of gestural control.

Gender is more likely the product of, rather than an explanation for,
linguistic variation [@eckertPodesva2021]. Just as with words, genders
are arbitrary; both the social labels and their acoustic correlates are
language specific [@johnson2005; @Johnson2006] and the constellation of
meanings are socially-constructed in interaction [@eckert2008]. The
formant ratios that distinguish 'male' from 'female' in Norwegian are
markedly different from the formant ratios that do this in Danish
[@Johnson2006]; what it means to be 'male' versus 'female' is quite
different in Thailand than in Japan [@kang2013; @alpert2014]. Children
don't perform adult-like vowel formant patterns because they were born
tiny men and women, children perform adult-like vowel formant patterns
because they identify as a gender and are using the cultural and
linguistic resources available to communicate that gender to others.
Humans are meaning-making agents, not deterministically resonating meat
tubes.

In the earliest sociophonetic perception research it was still possible
to imagine that the kind of knowledge listeners drew on to perceive
gender was knowledge of primary biological traits. We now understand
that, instead, the influence of gender-based expectations in speech
perception is evidence of the influence of cultural knowledge on what
might previously have been construed as purely linguistic decisions
[@boydfruehwaldhall-lew_2021]. Just as vowel quality, lip rounding, and
syllable affiliation influence the perception of these fricatives, so
too do socially-constructed gender categories.



This paper reports an audiovisual matched guise experiment with both
standard 'hidden' and novel 'unhidden' instruction conditions. The basic
task is a replication of @strandJohnson1996. Listeners are asked to
identify an ambiguous word as *sack* or *shack* on a [Êƒ]-[s]
continuum given manipulated beliefs about the gender identity of the
talker [@trippMunson2022; @steckerDOnofrioVolume]. As described above,
numerous previous replications have found that listeners perceive more
of the ambiguous continuum as [Êƒ] when they believe the speaker
identifies as a woman and more as [s] when they believe the speaker
identifies as a man and that, furthermore, this effect is
bi-directional, with fricative type influencing perception of gender for
an ambiguous voice [@bouavichithEtAl2019]. Unusually, participants in
the present study's 'unhidden' instruction condition were briefed, in
the instructions, about the guise manipulation. They were instructed
that the man or woman in the photo was not associated with the voice
they were listening to. [@campbell-kibler2020], using a similar
manipulation, finds that listeners have some ability to disregard social
information when making accentedness or attractiveness judgments but
that influence of available social information, particularly from the
voice, is difficult to disregard completely. In the present study,
participants were asked to provide a *sack*/*shack* lexical decision
either with, or without, explicit instructions to disregard the visual
stimulus.

# Method

## Participants

120 participants (self-identified 59 female, 61 male; ages 20 to 75)
were recruited to complete the online experiment online. These
participants were recruited through prolific.com and had provided
language history and demographic data as part of Prolific's general
pre-screening questionnaire. Participation was restricted to a standard
sample of desktop computer users located in the USA, who spent most of their childhoods in the
US, spoke English as their first and primary language, and with no known language or hearing difficulties. Additionally, due to an audio playback restriction imposed by Apple Computer, the Safari web browser could not be used. Participants were urged only to accept the task if they could do so in a quiet space, free from distractions and wearing headphones for the 6 to 10 minute duration of the experiment (average time 6:51). Headphone usage was not verified within the instrument. No participants' data were excluded from analysis.
Participants were paid \$3 for their time, pro-rated from a projected
rate of \$20/hour (actual rate: \$26.29/hour). This same instrument was
piloted in the Speech Perception lab of The Ohio State University and,
while reaction times online were generally slower than in-person,
results from the online administration were generally consistent with
results collected under laboratory conditions. Four participants were
excluded for low accuracy rates (below 85%).

## Stimulus Materials

### Auditory Stimuli

The auditory stimuli used in this study are the same wav-format files
used in [@bouavichithEtAl2019]. The stimuli, which were generously
shared with us, contain two parts, both of which are drawn from
synthetic continua: a fricative onset and a VC rime. The fricative
onsets comprise a synthetic six step /Êƒ-s/
continuum. These steps were generated with the Klatt Synthesizer in
Praat [@praat2001] using parameters identical to @munson2011
ranging between the values of Munson's second and eighth continuum steps
(which were, in turn, based on the parameters used in
@strandJohnson1996). Centers of Gravity ranged from 3.2 kHz
(/Êƒ/-like) to 7 kHz (/s/-like).

For the VC rime, two additional continua were modified from natural
productions of [Ã¦k] spoken by one male-identifying and one
female-identifying talker in the carrier phrase "Say sack again". These
five-step rime continua were created by evenly spacing
mean F0 across consecutive steps such that the male /Ã¦k/
continuum increased F0 frequency and formant spacing from their
unmodified values while the female talker's /Ã¦k/ continuum
decreased both parameters from unmodified.  Following the separate creations of these continua, each
synthesized fricative token was concatenated with each CV rime of
/Ã¦k/ resulting in a total of 60 unique auditory stimuli.
These manipulations are described in greater detail in Bouavichith et
al's section 2.1 and summarized visually in @fig-stimuli. Unlike
MGT studies that ask a talented, multi-dialectal talker to consciously
change their speech style [e.g. @wright2023], these stimuli were produced by one female and one male talker who were
asked to record speech in their normal voices. As these talkers
were advanced doctoral students in a linguistics PhD program, some of
the elements of such an identity are likely available to conscious
reflection, but many of these indexical features are likely implicit, unavailable for conscious control, even for them.

fricatives. F0 and F1:F2 Ratio plots show the manipulations to the Male
and Female voiced vowels.](images/figure1.png){#fig-stimuli width=80% fig-align="center"}

## Explicit Evaluations of Auditory Stimuli

Because voices carry social information, we elicited explicit social ratings to better understand how our auditory stimuli might influence participants' perception of the identities of the two talkers.40 undergraduate students at the Ohio State University (25 female, 15 male, ages 18-26) who participated in an in-person pilot version of the inverse matched guise experiment were asked to make judgments regarding the gender, gender prototypicality, and sexuality of a natural, unresynthesized, production of *sack* produced by each of the two talkers. Participants listened to the recording and then selected from a fixed set of responses; no free form responses were elicited.

Participants' judgments of the female voice indicate general agreement
about the gender identity of the speaker. Most participants
(93%) indicated the speaker's gender to be female (2 participants further specified 'trans-female'), and 3 were unsure or otherwise unable to determine the speaker's gender. For the female voice, average prototypicality ratings (in which, for a given gender, 0 is least prototypical, and 5 is most prototypical) were 4.3/5 if the participant had indicated 'female', and 2.75/5 if the participant had indicated 'trans female'. Judgements of the voice's sexuality were more variable, with 54% indicating they were unsure, 40% indicating the speaker was most likely heterosexual, and 1 participant each indicating the speaker was most likely bisexual or another sexuality.

Participants' judgments of the male voice suggest similar agreement. 80% of participants indicated the speaker's gender to be
male,(1 further specified 'trans-male') and 21% were
unsure of the gender of the speaker. Average prototypicality ratings
were lower for the male speaker but similarly consistent: 3.6/5 if the
participant had indicated the voice belonged to a 'male' speaker, and
2/5 if they had indicated the person speaking was a 'trans male'. As
with the female voice, judgements of the voice's sexuality were more
variable. 65% indicated they were unsure, 14% indicated the speaker was
most likely heterosexual, and 16% indicated homosexual and, again, 1
each indicating the speaker was most likely bisexual, or another
sexuality not listed. Crucially, no participants rated the female voice as male, or the male voice as female. The variation among ratings may be due to the presentation of options beyond binary female and male categories, and/or to the current cultural understanding of gender performance as distinct from sex. Despite this variability in responses, no 'implausible' answers were given. All things being equal, it is reasonable for a listener to believe there may be little perceptual difference in cis and trans voices for either male or female performances @zimman2018, and reasonable to consider 'unsure' the most acceptable option in lieu of asking the talker for their gender identity.

### Visual Stimuli

The visual stimuli used in this study, again identical to the images
used in [@bouavichithEtAl2019], are shown in @fig-visual.
These included two face images, used for the guise manipulation, which
were retrieved from the Chicago Face Database [@ChicagoFaceDatabase], a
resource containing high-resolution, normed images of faces indexed by
gender and ethnicity. The faces selected were normalized
for both physical attributes (i.e., measurements of particular facial
dimensions), subjective ratings such as attractiveness, and for gender
and gender prototypicality. As in Bouavichith et al., CFD-WF-015-006-N
was selected as the representation of the gender-protypical female
talker and CFD-WM-029-023-N was selected as the representation of the
gender-prototypical male talker. Both images were converted to greyscale
at the command line using ImageMagick [@imagemagick].

Additionally, two gray-scale line drawings were used as visual
representations of *shack* and *sack*. These images were used in place
of orthographic targets both to maintain consistency with Bouavichith et
al's design and to facilitate future eye tracking investigation of this
phenomenon.

## Procedure

The experiment was created in OpenSesame v3.3 [@opensesame] and exported
for the web using OSWeb v1.4.14.0. Modifications to the experiment
included translating portions of the python code into JavaScript and
adding code to collect Prolific IDs and provide proof of completion to
Prolific at the end of the experiment. This experiment was hosted on a
JATOS [@JATOS] instance hosted on an Ohio State University Linguistics
Department server. Participants received a link to the experiment via
Prolific and used their own computers, keyboards, and headphones to
complete the experiment.

In a between-subjects design, participants were randomly assigned to one
of two awareness conditions. These conditions differed only in the
initial information provided as to the nature of the experiment.
Participants in the *hidden* condition experienced a standard Matched
Guise task. They were given no information about the task or the
stimulus materials beyond the general instructions for completing the
experiment: listen to the voice, press 'z' if you heard the word on the
left, press 'm' for the word on the right. Participants in the
*unhidden* condition also received this instruction and were given a
partial debriefing regarding the task. They were informed that-- while
they would see faces onscreen while hearing words-- the voices in a
given trial were not produced by the person shown in the images, the
images had been downloaded from a database of photographs created at the
University of Chicago for experimental use, and that the auditory and
visual stimuli were in no way related to each other. Participants were
divided equally among these two conditions. Neither awareness condition
was informed about the synthetic nature of the auditory stimuli.

Additionally, participants were assigned to one of two gender congruity
conditions. Although the manipulated rimes sounded gender ambiguous to
us, and had been rated as ambiguous by [@bouavichithEtAl2019]'s pilot
participants, the possibility remained that the voices, particularly at
the end-points, might be perceived incongruously with the faces as in,
for example, [@McGowan2015][^1].

[^1]: We are choosing the words 'congruous' and 'incongruous' [@schulman1974] intentionally to suggest faces and voices may pattern together in particular ways in listeners' experience and perception with no implied claim that voices may 'match' or 'mismatch' in some way that suggests either experimenters or participants have veridical access to an objective reality.

In congruous trials, the faces and voices were paired such that
participants were only presented with auditory stimuli from the female
talker's continuum alongside the female face and tokens from the male
talker were only presented alongside the male face. In incongruous
trials, by contrast, auditory stimuli from the female talker's continuum
were only ever presented alongside the male face and tokens from the
male talker's continuum were only ever presented alongside the female
face. Half of participants were randomly assigned to each congruity
condition, resulting in a 4-way between-subjects design across
instruction and congruity conditions. Each participant heard all 60
auditory stimuli; 30 paired with the male face and 30 paired with the
female face.

In each trial, participants were shown one of the two faces for 1500ms.
Following this initial presentation, the face remained onscreen and was
flanked by the *shack* and *sack* images. Simultaneously, one of the
auditory stimuli was played over the headphones. The trial ended when
the participant pressed an appropriate key on their physical keyboard
and their response and reaction time data were uploaded to the JATOS
instance. In both congruous and incongruous conditions, all 60 unique
trials (30 per face) were presented twice to each participant for a
total of 120 trials.

# Predicted Results

## Face: male or female

Consistent with previous results, we expect to replicate the Strand
effect; in general, we anticipate that more of the [Êƒ]-[s] continuum
will be heard as [Êƒ] when participants are shown the female face and
more to be heard as [s] when participants are shown the male face.
However, these general predictions about the Face presentation when the
congruence of auditory and visual components of the guise are taken as a
whole.

## Congruence: pairing of face and voice

To our knowledge, the influence of congruence has not been directly
investigated for listeners' joint perception of gender and fricative
place. [@johnsonstranddimperio1999] tested AV integration of Male and
Female faces with prototypical and non-prototypical gendered voices in a
vowel quality perception task. They find what appears to be an
incongruence effect with the prototypical male voice; listeners reported
no difference in perceived vowel quality with this voice in either Face
condition [@johnsonstranddimperio1999 p. 376, Table 4]. For this reason,
we anticipate a replication of the Strand effect on fricative
identification in our congruous trials (when Face and Voice do not
conflict) but a failure to replicate for the incongruous trials (when
Face and Voice provide conflicting social information). This difference
may be stronger with the male voice, given both Johnson, Strand, and
D'Imperio's finding but also [@king2021].

We make a similar prediction for reaction times.
[@johnsonstranddimperio1999] did not collect reaction time data, but
[@McGowan2011] reports longer reaction times for incongruous trials,
albeit in a very different task, and [@whalen1984] would seem to suggest
that this should hold for listeners' identification of fricatives on a
[Êƒ]-[s] continuum. Specifically, we predict longer reaction times,
in general, for the Incongruous conditions. Furthermore, when gender
information is most clear, at gender continuum steps 1 and 2 for the
Male talker and at gender steps 4 & 5 for the Female talker, and in
conflict with the presented Face, listeners' response times should be
slower.

Since strong phonetic correlates of gender, F0 and F3, have been
manipulated over the course of the VC rime continua in our auditory
stimuli, we anticipate that the effect of incongruous face and voice
should be strongest for the natural end points of the continua where the
difference is most salient and weaker as phonetically-cued gender
information becomes more ambiguous. These stimuli have been
independently normed for ambiguity [@bouavichithEtAl2019 p. 1040, Table
1] in the 2nd and 3rd levels of the rime continua. This means we
anticipate an interaction between Face and Rime step but only in the
incongruous trials and only at the extremes of the rime continuum.

## Guise: Hidden or Unhidden

The primary goal of this experiment was to explore the role of listener
awareness and control in the matched guise technique. The tremendous
care researchers take to ensure that the guise manipulation is hidden
from participants suggests a kind of imagined fragility of
the effects of social information on language perception. From this
view: listeners who become aware of the guise manipulation will have
introspective access to and deliberative control over the influence of
visual social information on perception. If this is true, explaining the
guise manipulation, in the unhidden condition, should have a strongly
negative effect on the Strand effect. Alternatively, if the influence of
social information is not available to introspection or deliberative
control, we should see no change between the (traditional) hidden
matched guise and the unhidden guise.

Additionally, we speculate that there may be a response time difference
between the Hidden and Unhidden guises even if there is no apparent
difference in percept between the conditions. It can certainly be the
case that participants will arrive at the same behavioral responses via
different cognitive processing paths, perhaps drawing on different
levels of knowledge and awareness, and that these differences may be
visible in response times between the Instruction conditions.

# Results

Participants provided a total of 14,400 trials (120 trials from each of
120 online participants; 3600 trials in each instruction
x congruity condition). It is not clear what it means to be 'accurate'
when asked to perceive fricatives from a continuum so accuracy was
calculated only for responses to the [Êƒ] and [s] endpoints. Overall,
participants were highly accurate (96.8%) but four participants were
excluded from further analysis for accuracy below the pre-determined 85%
threshold reducing the total number of trials to 13,920. Trials were
coded as correct if the participant responded 'shack' to onset step 1 or
'sack' to onset step 6. The four excluded participants all scored 67.5%
accuracy or lower.

An additional 50 trials were excluded due to response times that were
either too fast or too slow. To reduce the effects of response time
outliers on subsequent analyses, all response times shorter than 50 ms
(N=0) and longer than 5000ms (N=50) were excluded. The 5000ms response
time cutoff was used instead of imposing an in-experiment time limit on
responses to a trial to ensure that participants were required to
respond to each trial. Altogether, 530 trials were
excluded, leaving data from 13,870 trials for analysis (approximately
96.3% of the initial data set). The majority (96.8%) of the remaining
response times were within a range between 200 and 2000ms. To increase
normality of the distribution of response times across participants, the
remaining response times were log-transformed.

## [Êƒ]-[s] Percepts

@fig-scurve presents listeners' percepts on this 2AFC task.
The horizontal axis in each of these four plots is the fricative
(syllable Onset) continuum step. Step 1 of the continuum is most
[Êƒ]-like, step 6 is the most [s]-like, steps 3 & 4 are the most
ambiguous. Darker lines in @fig-scurve present trials using the female Face; lighter
lines present trials using the male Face. The Hidden and Unhidden
instruction conditions are represented by the left and right columns of
figures, respectively. The rows present the Congruous blocks where Face
and Coda speaker voice shared a gender identity (top) and Incongruous
trials where Face and Coda speaker voice mismatched in gender identity
(bottom).

!['sack' responses plotted as a function of [Êƒ]-[s] fricative (Onset)
continuum steps and purported gender presented by the face.](images/Scurve.png){#fig-scurve fig-align="center" width=80%}

A successful replication of the Strand effect would mean that a higher
proportion of the ambiguous stimuli would be heard as [s] when the
purported gender suggested by the face is male than when the face is
female. This pattern appears to hold in both the Hidden and Unhidden
conditions, but only when gender identity of the talker who produced the
CV rime stimuli was congruous with the gender presented in the visual
portion of the guise. From @fig-scurve it would appear that listeners' reported
percepts more closely track the voice of the talker than the face in the
picture when these sources of information are incongruous.


!['sack' responses on ambiguous fricative trials
plotted as a function of CV rime continuum steps and gender identity of
stimulus talker.](images/ambiguous-by-rime-step.png){#fig-rimes fig-align="center" width=80%}


We predicted that, since strong phonetic correlates of gender have been
manipulated over the course of the VC rime continua, the effect of
incongruence should be strongest for the end points of the continua
where the social information presented by the voice is, presumably, most
salient and weaker as phonetically-cued gender information becomes more
ambiguous. @fig-rimes suggests that this prediction is at least
partially borne out. @fig-rimes plots proportion 'sack' responses to the ambiguous portion of the
[Êƒ]-[s] continuum (steps 3 & 4) as a function of rime continuum
step. The meaning of line color has changed in this figure. Dark lines
represent the male talker and lighter lines represent the female talker.
Step 1 on this continuum includes the most natural token for the male
talker and the most manipulated token for the female talker while step 5
includes the most natural token for the male talker and the most
manipulated token for the female talker. As before, columns present the
Hidden and Unhidden conditions while rows present the Congruous and
Incongruous blocks.

In a 2AFC task with unbiased stimuli, chance is 50%. Responses at the .5
line in @fig-rimes suggest that the ambiguous fricatives remained
ambiguous while responses that tend to be above this line reflect a
tendency toward [s] percepts and responses that tend to be below this
line reflect a tendency toward [Êƒ]. Across all 4 conditions we observe
a declination from highest-proportion [s] responses in step 1 of the
F0 continua to lowest in step 5. When face and voice were congruous,
virtually all male-voice (and male face) responses are above or at 50%
'sack' and virtually all female-voiced (and female face) responses are
at or *below* 50% 'sack'. This is the same pattern that can be observed
at Onset continuum steps 3 & 4 in @fig-scurve. It is not clear from @fig-rimes
alone if there is any difference at all between the Congruous and
Incongruous conditions. However, it is important to recall about the
bottom row of this figure that male talker responses in the incongruous
trials were presented with a female face while female talker trials were
presented with a male face. Even a weakly-significant Strand effect
would predict that the female talker, particularly on the more ambiguous
continuum steps, should show more 'sack' responses consistent with
having been shown a male face and no such effect is evident in this
plot.

Indeed, a striking feature of these figures ([-@fig-scurve; -@fig-rimes]) is how the apparent influence of gender information flips between congruous and incongruous conditions in the former but remains essentially constant in the latter. Taken together, these plots suggest that cues to gender in F0 is a stronger predictor of listeners' reported percept in this matched guise task than just the purported gender of the face.

Finally, the main objective of this experiment was to explore the role
of listener awareness in the matched guise technique. Here again there
may be differences between the congruous and incongruous conditions that
will be better understood through quantitative analysis, but the overall
trend is clear. If there is an effect of explaining to participants that
the voice and face in the matched guise task are unrelated to each
other, that effect is so weak as to be essentially invisible in these
visual interrogations of the data. Categorical responses in the Hidden
and Unhidden instruction conditions appear to be identical.

## Logistic Regression and Quantitative Analysis

These qualitative assessments of listener responses can be examined
further through quantitative analysis. Through model comparison we
initially arrived at a logistic mixed model to predict percept with
Congruity condition, instruction condition, Onset step, Face, and Rime
step with interactions for all but Rime step. This model was justified
by model selection but given the notorious difficulty of interpreting a
4-way interaction and the preceding visual interrogation of the data, we
opted to separate Congruence into a pair of 3-way models. Using
`glmer()` [@lme4], we divided the data into congruous and incongruous
subsets and fitted a pair of logistic mixed models (estimated using ML
and BOBYQA optimizer) to predict percept with Instruction condition,
Onset.step, Face and Rime step
(`percept ~ Instruction * Onset.step * Face + Rime.step`). The models
included random intercepts for subject. All categorical predictors were
coded using contrast coding.


![Beta coefficients for listener responses in the
Congruous (black) and Incongruous (gray) logistic regression models
plotted with 95% confidence intervals.](images/coefs_instruction.png){#fig-coefs width=80%}


Beta coefficients for the two separate logistic mixed models are plotted together in @fig-coefs. Terms plotted to the left of the dashed zero line have a negative influence on 'sack' percepts in the model while terms plotted to the right have a positive influence. As a consistency check we can observe that the levels of the Onset continuum behave in precisely the expected ways and all levels are statistically significant predictors of percept in both models. Onset step 1 ([Êƒ]) is negatively associated with 'sack' responses and significant in both the Congruous ($Î²=-5.00$, $SE=0.28$, $p < 0.001$) and Incongruous
($Î²=-4.84$, $SE=0.24$, $p < 0.001$) models. Onset step 5 ([s]) is positively associated with 'sack' responses and significant in both the Congruous ($Î²=4.35$, $SE=0.22$, $p < 0.001$) and Incongruous ($Î²=4.12$, $SE=0.19$, $p < 0.001$) models.

As visual inspection of the data suggests, this study includes a
replication of the Strand effect in the Congruous condition. There is a
main effect of Face in the model ($Î²=-0.22, SE=0.09, p<0.05$). Face is
negatively associated with 'sack' responses suggesting that, with these
stimuli, at least, it is more appropriate to understand the effect of
Face as an increase of 'shack' responses given the female Face. The
inclusion of the interaction term for Onset and Face allows us to see
that the effect of Face is greatest on the ambiguous Onset steps 3
($Î²=-0.43$, $SE=0.11$, $p < 0.001$) and, to a lesser extent, 4
($Î²=-0.23$, $SE=0.11$, $p < 0.05$).

However, the Strand effect observed in the Congruous condition is not
attributable entirely to the main effect of Face. Rime F0 is also
significant; Rime level 1, the male end of the continuum, is positively
associated with 'sack' responses ($Î²=0.61$, $SE=0.10$, $p < 0.001$) as is
Rime level 2 ($Î²=0.52$, $SE=0.10$, $p < 0.001$). Rime level 3, where the
continuum is most gender ambiguous, is not statistically significant.
Rime level 4, on the female end of the continuum, is negatively
associated with 'sack' responses and significant
($Î²=-0.49$, $SE=0.10$, $p < 0.001$).

Unsurprisingly, the Strand effect has not been replicated in the
incongruous condition. As is visible in the bottom row of @fig-scurve, the effect of Face on 'sack' responses is not
significant. The interaction of Onset and Face also behaves quite
differently in the Incongruous model. Onset x Face is negatively
associated with 'sack' responses at Onset step 1
($Î²=-0.66$, $SE=0.24$, $p < 0.001$) but positively associated with 'sack'
responses and significant at Onset step 3 ($Î²=0.27$, $SE=0.11$, $p < 0.05$).

Interestingly, the significant effect of Rime observed in the Congruous
model also holds, nearly identically, in the Incongruous model. Rime
level 1, the male end of the continuum, is again positively associated
with 'sack' responses ($Î²=0.77$, $SE=0.10$, $p < 0.001$) as is Rime level 2
($Î²=0.41$, $SE=0.10$, $p < 0.001$). Rime level 3 is also not statistically
significant in the Incongruous model. Rime level 4, on the female end of
the continuum, is negatively associated with 'sack' responses and
significant ($Î²=-0.36$, $SE=0.10$, $p < 0.001$).

Finally, the quantitative analysis of the primary objective of this experiment, exploring the effect of unhiding the matched guise manipulation from participants, largely supports the qualitative analysis. As can be observed in @fig-coefs, there is no significant main effect of Instruction condition in either model. Still, a somewhat more nuanced picture emerges from the interactions of Instruction condition with Onset and the 3 way interaction of Instruction, Onset, and Face in the Congruous trials. The interaction of Instruction with Onset is significant, or nearly so, at every step of the fricative continuum other than the most significant. In the [Êƒ]-like portion of the continuum, the interaction with face is positively associated with 'sack' responses at step 1 ($Î²=0.65$, $SE=0.28$, $p < 0.05$) and 2 ($Î²=0.44$, $SE=0.18$, $p < 0.05$). The interaction of guise with the most ambiguous onset step is not
significant ($Î²=0.011$, $SE=0.12$). The interaction of Instruction with
Onset step 4, on the [s] end of the continuum is negatively associated
with 'sack' responses and statistically significant ($Î²=-0.43$, $SE=0.12$, $p < 0.001$). Instruction x Onset step4 is also negatively associated with 'sack' responses but does not reach significance at the standard alpha level
($Î²=-0.40$, $SE=0.22$, $p = 0.067$). The 3-way interaction of Instruction x
Onset x Face is positively associated with 'sack' responses at step 2
($Î²=0.41$, $SE=0.17$, $p < 0.05$) and weakly, but not significantly,
negatively associated with 'sack' responses at step 5 ($Î²=-0.38$, $SE=0.21$, $p = 0.080$).

There is also no main effect of Instruction in the Incongruous trials.
The 3-way interaction of Instruction x Onset x Face, while justified by
model selection for inclusion in this model, also does not reach
statistical significance. However the 2-way interaction of Instruction
with Onset step is positively associated with 'sack' responses at Onset
step 2 ($Î²=0.53$, $SE=0.21$, $p < 0.05$) and approaches significance at step
3, where it is weakly positively associated
($Î²=0.18$, $SE=0.11, $p = 0.095$) and step 5 where it is weakly negatively
associated ($Î²=-0.32$, $SE=0.19$, $p = 0.086$).

## Response Times

As with the logistic regression models, we again opted to separate
Congruence into a pair of 3-way models for linear mixed model analysis
of our log-transformed response time data. Using `lmer()` [@lme4], we
reused the congruous and incongruous subsets created for the logistic
regression models and We fitted a linear mixed model (estimated using
REML and nloptwrap optimizer) to predict logRT with Guise, Onset, Face
and Rime (`logRT ~ Instruction * Onset * Face + Rime`). The models
included random intercepts for subject. All categorical predictors were
coded using contrast coding. Beta coefficients for both models are
plotted in @fig-coefs-logRT. Terms plotted to the left of the zero line
are associated with a decrease in log response time while terms plotted
to the right of the zero line are associated with an increase in log
response time. Notably, the longest response times are associated with
the most ambiguous steps of the [Êƒ]-[s] onset continuum. Onset step
3 is positively associated with response time and significant in both
the congruous ($Î²=0.08$, $SE=0.007$, $p < 0.001$) and incongruous
($Î²=0.0$7, $SE=0.007$, $p < 0.001$ ) models. The same is true of step 4 in
the congruous ($Î²=0.07$, $SE=0.007$, $p < 0.001$) and incongruous
($Î²=0.07$, $SE=0.007$, $p < 0.001$) models as well. On the other hand, steps
1, 2, and 5 are all negatively associated with response time and also
significant in both models (see @fig-coefs-logRT).

![Beta coefficients for log-transformed response
times in the Congruous (black) and Incongruous (gray) linear regression
models plotted with 95% confidence intervals.](images/coefs-logRT_instructions.png){#fig-coefs-logRT width=80%}


We predicted overall slower response times in the Incongruous than
Congruous conditions and this prediction is not borne out by the data.
Apart from generally higher variability in the incongruous conditions,
there is no positive or negative trend in response times between the two
Congruity models. For example, within the Incongruous model response
times given the interaction of Onset step 3 \* Face are longer
($Î²=-0.009$, $SE=0.007$, $p = 0.17$), which would seem to support our
prediction, but response times for Onset step 4 \* Face are shorter
($Î²-0.02$, $SE=0.007$, $p < 0.01$), the opposite of what we predicted. The
exact opposite pattern appears within the Congruous model where response
times are shorter given Onset 3 \* Face ($Î²=-0.02$, $SE=0.007$, $p < 0.01$)
but longer given Onset step 4 \* Face ($Î²=0.04$, $SE=0.007$, $p < 0.001$).
These crossing patterns can be seen in @fig-coefs-logRT.

Given the replication of the Strand effect in the Congruous, but not the
Incongruous conditions described in the previous section, it may be
notable that there is a significant main effect of Face in the Congruous
model where it is negatively associated with response time
($Î²=0.22$, $SE=0.08$, $p < 0.05$) and not significant in the Incongruous
model.

# Discussion

The question that motivated this study was a desire to understand the
role of listener awareness and control in the matched guise technique.
We believe that the careful measures researchers generally employ to
obscure the nature of the guise manipulation from participants is
attributable to a long-held assumption in the sociolinguistics
literature that social knowledge is high-level knowledge, available to
introspective control, and that this differs from linguistic knowledge
which is low-level knowledge, unavailable to control
[@campbell-kibler2016]. The results of the present study are
inconsistent with this imagined fragility of the influence of social
knowledge. Revealing the nature of the guise manipulation did not
significantly influence listener responses in either the congruous or
incongruous conditions. Nor did this revelation have a significant
influence on response times in either condition.

The finding that the Matched Guise effect holds for speech perception
both when hidden from the participant and when unhidden is inconsistent
with a model of processing in which social knowledge simply acts as a
filter on linguistic knowledge. Social knowledge influences perception
even when listeners are aware that it is, or may be, false. This result
parallels previous results for accentedness and attractiveness judgments
[@campbell-kibler2020]. A similar result may be present, for social
information, in the within-participants guise manipulation of
[@mcgowanBabel2020]. In that study, the authors use participants'
metalinguistic commentaries to assess the extent to which the guise
manipulations were or were not 'believed'. The results of the present
study suggests that that belief may be irrelevant. The present result
also gives additional context to studies demonstrating influence of
social knowledge even when listeners have no reason to believe the guise
manipulation [@Niedzielski1999; @haynolandrager2006; @HayDrager2010]. It
is unclear whether social knowledge will prove to be as resilient to
awareness as the obligatory McGurk effect [@McGurkMacDonald1976] which
persists even when participants actively identify that the face and
voice in the experiment are mismatched [@GreenEtAl1991], but the
suggestion is that it will.

The gender identity of the talker who produced the VC Rime supplemented
Face in the Congruous conditions to make the Strand effect even
stronger; the mechanism may prove similar to the way lip-rounding
accentuates the backness of back vowels. In the Incongruous conditions,
though, listeners' perception of the [Êƒ]-[s] continuum tracked the
VC Rimes, rather than the purported gender of the Face. This pattern was
strongest in the least-ambiguous portions of the Rime continuum and
weakest in the most-ambiguous. In a sense, by separating trials by
congruity of face and voice we have replicated [@strandJohnson1996]'s
exp1 and exp2 simultaneously. One wonders, looking back at their exp2,
whether this classic result was *also* a congruous condition in which
listeners had sufficient gender information from the voice to supplement
the purported information from the Face. Even the non-prototypical
voices used in that study did pattern, in exp1, in weakly gendered ways.
This finding may provide some insight into recent failures to replicate
the original Strand effect [@schellingerMunsonEdwards2017;
@wilbanks2022].

The phonetic correlates of gender manipulated in the VC rimes for this
study are F0 and formant ratios. However, these may not be the only cues
listeners are drawing upon with their knowledge of US English. Surely,
F0 and vowel formant ratios *can be* important to listeners, just as
voice onset time and vocal fold vibration can be important cues to the
voicing of /t/ and /d/. But as [@lisker1986] catalogs, there are 16 cues
to this apparently simple feature in English, any of which might be
sufficient to communicate voicing, but none of which is required. In
this study we have used manipulated stimuli that obscure, over the
course of two gender continua, the gender identity of the talker who
produced the basis token for that continuum. At an explicit level, these
continua *sound ambiguous* to the experimenters in much the way that
[@whalen1984]'s stimuli do not sound obviously mismatched. But our
perception results suggest that listeners are still aware, albeit
implicitly, of the gender identity we have attempted to obscure by
altering the phonetic correlates of gender.

# Conclusion

Decades of research since [@strandJohnson1996]'s original finding have
demonstrated that a visual cue can shift fricative perceptions when
paired with an ambiguously-gendered voice (although cf Munson 2017 and
Wilbanks 2022). [@bouavichithEtAl2019] demonstrated with
eye-tracking that this effect is fast and bi-directional. One could come
away from Strand & Johnson's exp1 and exp2 and subsequent replications
with a theoretical model in which visually-cued social information and
phonetically-cued social information exert equivalent influence on
speech perception. Prototypically-gendered voices can shift perception
of a [Êƒ]-[s] continuum and prototypically-gendered visual
information can as well. However, listeners' behavior in our Congruous
and Incongruous conditions is inconsistent with such a model and
suggests, instead, that when visually-cued and phonetically-cued social
information are in congruence, they can enhance one another. When, on
the other hand, these information sources conflict, it is the
phonetically-cued social information that will dominate
[@campbell-kibler2020].

It is unlikely that fricatives are unique in this respect. For example,
the incongruous results seen in this study are, perhaps, predicted by
lack of Face effect for [@johnsonstranddimperio1999]'s vowel perception
results in exp2 given a stereotypical face (particularly, in that study,
for the male voice). As listeners, we do not have veridical access to
the speech sounds intended by a talker. Instead, we must combine the
speech signal with our phonological knowledge, lexical knowledge, social
expectations, visual input, expectations of the social world
[@BabelVolume] and other sensory information to arrive at a percept. The
implication is that perception is more holistic than is dreamt of in our
phonologies. Category boundaries, whether for speech sounds or social
categories, are fuzzy and perception needs to be fast. We retain
knowledge of, and use, detailed social and linguistic knowledge at both
high and low levels of processing. Enumerating the phonetic correlates
of gender may not be the wrong question, but it is certainly premature
given the limitations of current theory to account for what listeners
actually do. A better question is something like "what kinds of
knowledge do listeners draw on during perception and when?"

[@barrett2014 p. 205] writes, "any assumption of essentialism will
ultimately marginalize those individuals who do not fit the essentialist
understandings of human behavior". It may not feel brutal or reductive
to read [@may1976]'s findings about large and small vocal tracts as if
they refer to male and female vocal tracts, respectively, but it does
necessarily imply that tall, long-necked women and short, squat-necked
men need to find some other way of labeling themselves. The idea that
male voices come from large bodies and female voices come from small
bodies need not be literally true for the phonetic and perceptual
correlates of size to become enregistered alongside other features in
the creation of gendered personae (D'Onofrio 2020). Our prediction that
incongruity in face and voice would slow listener judgments was not
supported. It is tempting to interpret this as evidence that, unlike
misleading coarticulatory information, listeners are aware of the
diversity of gender expression, but this is not a question the current
study can resolve.

What the current study can resolve is that listeners' social knowledge
of speech is not delicate. The present result is equally inconsistent
with a model that disregards social knowledge entirely and with any
model of speech perception that presumes *all* social knowledge to be
late, high-level, and available to introspective control. Part of what
listeners know when they know a language includes the simultaneous
patterning of 'linguistic' and 'social' information in a shared phonetic
signal. Social knowledge is not a weakly-associated prime; Social
knowledge and linguistic knowledge are deeply intertwined in speech
perception and it is perverse to assume that the language subsystem
underlying this ability would necessarily distinguish them.
